    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named generateString that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given two strings, str1 and str2, of lengths n and m, respectively.
        A string word of length n + m - 1 is defined to be generated by str1 and str2 if it satisfies the following conditions for each index 0 <= i <= n - 1:

        If str1[i] == 'T', the substring of word with size m starting at index i is equal to str2, i.e., word[i..(i + m - 1)] == str2.
        If str1[i] == 'F', the substring of word with size m starting at index i is not equal to str2, i.e., word[i..(i + m - 1)] != str2.

        Return the lexicographically smallest possible string that can be generated by str1 and str2. If no string can be generated, return an empty string "".

        Constraints:

        1 <= n == str1.length <= 10^4
        1 <= m == str2.length <= 500
        str1 consists only of 'T' or 'F'.
        str2 consists only of lowercase English characters.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        generateString(str1 = "TFTF", str2 = "ab") == "ababa"
        generateString(str1 = "TFTF", str2 = "abc") == ""
        generateString(str1 = "F", str2 = "d") == "a"

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
