    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named minSwapsCouples that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        There are n couples sitting in 2n seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.
        The people and seats are represented by an integer array row where row[i] is the ID of the person sitting in the i^th seat. The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being (0, 1), the second couple being (2, 3), and so on with the last couple being (2n - 2, 2n - 1).
        Return the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

        Constraints:

        2n == row.length
        2 <= n <= 30
        n is even.
        0 <= row[i] < 2n
        All the elements of row are unique.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        minSwapsCouples(row = [0,2,1,3]) == 1
        minSwapsCouples(row = [3,2,0,1]) == 0

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
