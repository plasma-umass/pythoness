    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named minRefuelStops that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.
        There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the i^th gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has fueli liters of gas.
        The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.
        Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.
        Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

        Constraints:

        1 <= target, startFuel <= 10^9
        0 <= stations.length <= 500

        1 <= fueli < 10^9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        minRefuelStops(target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []) == 0
        minRefuelStops(target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]) == -1

    Task:

        A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.
        There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the i^th gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has fueli liters of gas.
        The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.
        Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.
        Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

        Constraints:

        1 <= target, startFuel <= 10^9
        0 <= stations.length <= 500
        1 <= positioni < positioni+1 < target
        1 <= fueli < 10^9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:

    A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.
    There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the i^th gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has fueli liters of gas.
    The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.
    Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.
    Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

    1 <= target, startFuel <= 10^9
