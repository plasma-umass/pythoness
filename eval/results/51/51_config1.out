    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named solveNQueens that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
        Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.
        Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        solveNQueens(n = 4) == [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
        solveNQueens(n = 1) == [["Q"]]

    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named solveNQueens that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
        Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.
        Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        solveNQueens(n = 4) == [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
        solveNQueens(n = 1) == [["Q"]]
