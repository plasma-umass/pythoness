    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function

    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        Given an unsorted integer array nums. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in nums.
        You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.

        Constraints:

        1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
        -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        firstMissingPositive(nums = [1,2,0]) == 3
        firstMissingPositive(nums = [3,4,-1,1]) == 2
        firstMissingPositive(nums = [7,8,9,11,12]) == 1

    [[Pythoness] New prompt:


    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named firstMissingPositive that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        Given an unsorted integer array nums. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in nums.
        You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.

        Constraints:

        1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
        -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
