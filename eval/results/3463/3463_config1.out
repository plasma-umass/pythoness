    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named hasSameDigits that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given a string s consisting of digits. Perform the following operation repeatedly until the string has exactly two digits:

        For each pair of consecutive digits in s, starting from the first digit, calculate a new digit as the sum of the two digits modulo 10.
        Replace s with the sequence of newly calculated digits, maintaining the order in which they are computed.

        Return true if the final two digits in s are the same; otherwise, return false.

        Constraints:

        3 <= s.length <= 10^5
        s consists of only digits.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        hasSameDigits(s = "3902") == True
        hasSameDigits(s = "34789") == False

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
