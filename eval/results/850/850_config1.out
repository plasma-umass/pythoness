    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named rectangleArea that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.

    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    Task:

        You are given a 2D array of axis-aligned rectangles. Each rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2] denotes the i^th rectangle where (xi1, yi1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (xi2, yi2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
        Calculate the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Any area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted once.
        Return the total area. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

        Constraints:

        1 <= rectangles.length <= 200
        rectanges[i].length == 4
        0 <= xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2 <= 10^9
        xi1 <= xi2
        yi1 <= yi2
        All rectangles have non zero area.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        rectangleArea(rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]) == 6
        rectangleArea(rectangles = [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]) == 49

    [[Pythoness] Prompt:
 
    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named rectangleArea that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        You are given a 2D array of axis-aligned rectangles. Each rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2] denotes the i^th rectangle where (xi1, yi1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (xi2, yi2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
        Calculate the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Any area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted once.
        Return the total area. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

        Constraints:

        1 <= rectangles.length <= 200
        rectanges[i].length == 4
        0 <= xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2 <= 10^9
        xi1 <= xi2
        yi1 <= yi2
        All rectangles have non zero area.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        rectangleArea(rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]) == 6
        rectangleArea(rectangles = [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]) == 49

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```
