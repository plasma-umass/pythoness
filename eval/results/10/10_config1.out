    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named isMatch that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

        '.' Matches any single character.    
        '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

        The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 20
        1 <= p.length <= 20
        s contains only lowercase English letters.
        p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
        It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        isMatch(s = "aa", p = "a") == False
        isMatch(s = "aa", p = "a*") == True
        isMatch(s = "ab", p = ".*") == True

    Task:

        Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

        '.' Matches any single character.    
        '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

        The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 20
        1 <= p.length <= 20
        s contains only lowercase English letters.
        p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
        It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        isMatch(s = "aa", p = "a") == False
        isMatch(s = "aa", p = "a*") == True
        isMatch(s = "ab", p = ".*") == True

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```
