    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named maxKDivisibleComponents that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
        You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where values[i] is the value associated with the i^th node, and an integer k.
        A valid split of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges, possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have values that are divisible by k, where the value of a connected component is the sum of the values of its nodes.
        Return the maximum number of components in any valid split.

        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 3 * 10^4
        edges.length == n - 1
        edges[i].length == 2

        values.length == n
        0 <= values[i] <= 10^9
        1 <= k <= 10^9
        Sum of values is divisible by k.
        The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        maxKDivisibleComponents(n = 5, edges = [[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]], values = [1,8,1,4,4], k = 6) == 2
