    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named atMostNGivenDigitSet that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        Given an array of digits which is sorted in non-decreasing order. You can write numbers using each digits[i] as many times as we want. For example, if digits = ['1','3','5'], we may write numbers such as '13', '551', and '1351315'.
        Return the number of positive integers that can be generated that are less than or equal to a given integer n.

        Constraints:

        1 <= digits.length <= 9
        digits[i].length == 1
        digits[i] is a digit from '1' to '9'.
        All the values in digits are unique.
        digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
        1 <= n <= 10^9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        atMostNGivenDigitSet(digits = ["1","3","5","7"], n = 100) == 20
        atMostNGivenDigitSet(digits = ["1","4","9"], n = 1000000000) == 29523
        atMostNGivenDigitSet(digits = ["7"], n = 8) == 1
