    [[Pythoness] Prompt:
 
    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named trap that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

        Constraints:

        n == height.length
        1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
        0 <= height[i] <= 10^5

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        trap(height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]) == 6
        trap(height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]) == 9

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```

    def trap(height: List[int]) -> int:
        """"""
