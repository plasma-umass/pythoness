    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named maxDistance that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given an integer side, representing the edge length of a square with corners at (0, 0), (0, side), (side, 0), and (side, side) on a Cartesian plane.
        You are also given a positive integer k and a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinate of a point lying on the boundary of the square.
        You need to select k elements among points such that the minimum Manhattan distance between any two points is maximized.
        Return the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance between the selected k points.
        The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

        Constraints:

        1 <= side <= 10^9
        4 <= points.length <= min(4 * side, 15 * 10^3)
        points[i] == [xi, yi]
        The input is generated such that:

        points[i] lies on the boundary of the square.
        All points[i] are unique.


        4 <= k <= min(25, points.length)

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        maxDistance(side = 2, points = [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2],[0,0]], k = 4) == 2
        maxDistance(side = 2, points = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k = 4) == 1
        maxDistance(side = 2, points = [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k = 5) == 1

        You are given an integer side, representing the edge length of a square with corners at (0, 0), (0, side), (side, 0), and (side, side) on a Cartesian plane.
        You are also given a positive integer k and a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinate of a point lying on the boundary of the square.
        You need to select k elements among points such that the minimum Manhattan distance between any two points is maximized.
        Return the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance between the selected k points.
        The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

        Constraints:

        1 <= side <= 10^9
        4 <= points.length <= min(4 * side, 15 * 10^3)
        points[i] == [xi, yi]
        The input is generated such that:

        points[i] lies on the boundary of the square.
        All points[i] are unique.


        4 <= k <= min(25, points.length)

    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        maxDistance(side = 2, points = [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2],[0,0]], k = 4) == 2

          You are given an integer side, representing the edge length of a square with corners at (0, 0), (0, side), (side, 0), and (side, side) on a Cartesian plane.
          You are also given a positive integer k and a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinate of a point lying on the boundary of the square.
          You need to select k elements among points such that the minimum Manhattan distance between any two points is maximized.
          Return the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance between the selected k points.
          The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
