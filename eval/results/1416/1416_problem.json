The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1, k] and there are no leading zeros in the array.\nGiven the string s and the integer k, return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as s using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"1000\", k = 10000\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The only possible array is [1000]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"1000\", k = 10\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There cannot be an array that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"1317\", k = 2000\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Possible arrays are [1317],[131,7],[13,17],[1,317],[13,1,7],[1,31,7],[1,3,17],[1,3,1,7]\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 10^5\ns consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.\n1 <= k <= 10^9\n\n",
