    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named numberOfArrays that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1, k] and there are no leading zeros in the array.
        Given the string s and the integer k, return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as s using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        s consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.
        1 <= k <= 10^9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        numberOfArrays(s = "1000", k = 10000) == 1
        numberOfArrays(s = "1000", k = 10) == 0
        numberOfArrays(s = "1317", k = 2000) == 8

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:

    Task:

        A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1, k] and there are no leading zeros in the array.
        Given the string s and the integer k, return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as s using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        s consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.
        1 <= k <= 10^9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        numberOfArrays(s = "1000", k = 10000) == 1
        numberOfArrays(s = "1000", k = 10) == 0
        numberOfArrays(s = "1317", k = 2000) == 8

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```
