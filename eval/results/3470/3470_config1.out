    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named permute that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        Given two integers, n and k, an alternating permutation is a permutation of the first n positive integers such that no two adjacent elements are both odd or both even.
        Return the k-th alternating permutation sorted in lexicographical order. If there are fewer than k valid alternating permutations, return an empty list.

        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 100
        1 <= k <= 10^15

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        permute(n = 4, k = 6) == [3,4,1,2]
        permute(n = 3, k = 2) == [3,2,1]

    [[Pythoness] Prompt:
 
    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named permute that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        Given two integers, n and k, an alternating permutation is a permutation of the first n positive integers such that no two adjacent elements are both odd or both even.
        Return the k-th alternating permutation sorted in lexicographical order. If there are fewer than k valid alternating permutations, return an empty list.

        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 100
        1 <= k <= 10^15

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        permute(n = 4, k = 6) == [3,4,1,2]
        permute(n = 3, k = 2) == [3,2,1]
        permute(n = 2, k = 3) == []

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```
