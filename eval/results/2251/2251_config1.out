    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named fullBloomFlowers that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array flowers, where flowers[i] = [starti, endi] means the i^th flower will be in full bloom from starti to endi (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array people of size n, where people[i] is the time that the i^th person will arrive to see the flowers.
        Return an integer array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the number of flowers that are in full bloom when the i^th person arrives.

        Constraints:

        1 <= flowers.length <= 5 * 10^4

    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except

    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        fullBloomFlowers(flowers = [[1,6],[3,7],[9,12],[4,13]], people = [2,3,7,11]) == [1,2,2,2]
        fullBloomFlowers(flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]], people = [3,3,2]) == [2,2,1]
