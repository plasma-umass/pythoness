    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named checkRecord that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

        'A': Absent.
        'L': Late.
        'P': Present.

        Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

        The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
        The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.

        Given an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of length n that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 10^5

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        checkRecord(n = 2) == 8
        checkRecord(n = 1) == 3
        checkRecord(n = 10101) == 183236316

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:

    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named checkRecord that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

        'A': Absent.
        'L': Late.
        'P': Present.

        Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

        The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
        The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.

        Given an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of length n that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 10^5

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        checkRecord(n = 2) == 8
        checkRecord(n = 1) == 3
        checkRecord(n = 10101) == 183236316

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:

    [[Pythoness] Prompt:
 
    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named checkRecord that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

        'A': Absent.
        'L': Late.
        'P': Present.

        Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

        The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
        The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.

        Given an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of length n that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 10^5

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        checkRecord(n = 2) == 8
        checkRecord(n = 1) == 3
        checkRecord(n = 10101) == 183236316

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```
