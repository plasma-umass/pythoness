    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named lenOfVDiagonal that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given a 2D integer matrix grid of size n x m, where each element is either 0, 1, or 2.
        A V-shaped diagonal segment is defined as:

        The segment starts with 1.
        The subsequent elements follow this infinite sequence: 2, 0, 2, 0, ....
        The segment:

        Starts along a diagonal direction (top-left to bottom-right, bottom-right to top-left, top-right to bottom-left, or bottom-left to top-right).
        Continues the sequence in the same diagonal direction.
        Makes at most one clockwise 90-degree turn to another diagonal direction while maintaining the sequence.




        Return the length of the longest V-shaped diagonal segment. If no valid segment exists, return 0.

        Constraints:

        n == grid.length
        m == grid[i].length
        1 <= n, m <= 500
        grid[i][j] is either 0, 1 or 2.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        lenOfVDiagonal(grid = [[2,2,1,2,2],[2,0,2,2,0],[2,0,1,1,0],[1,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,2]]) == 5
