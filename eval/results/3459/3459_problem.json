If no valid segment exists, return 0.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[2,2,1,2,2],[2,0,2,2,0],[2,0,1,1,0],[1,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,2]]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\n\nThe longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 5 and follows these coordinates: (0,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (2,4), takes a 90-degree clockwise turn at (2,4), and continues as (3,3) \u2192 (4,2).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,0,2,2,0],[2,0,1,1,0],[1,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,2]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\n\nThe longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 4 and follows these coordinates: (2,3) \u2192 (3,2), takes a 90-degree clockwise turn at (3,2), and continues as (2,1) \u2192 (1,0).\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,0],[2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,0]]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\n\nThe longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 5 and follows these coordinates: (0,0) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (4,4).\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: grid = [[1]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nThe longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 1 and follows these coordinates: (0,0).\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nn == grid.length\nm == grid[i].length\n1 <= n, m <= 500\ngrid[i][j] is either 0, 1 or 2.\n\n",
