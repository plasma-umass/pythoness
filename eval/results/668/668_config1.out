    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named findKthNumber that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.

    Task:

        Nearly everyone has used the Multiplication Table. The multiplication table of size m x n is an integer matrix mat where mat[i][j] == i * j (1-indexed).
        Given three integers m, n, and k, return the k^th smallest element in the m x n multiplication table.

        Constraints:

        1 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4
        1 <= k <= m * n

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        findKthNumber(m = 3, n = 3, k = 5) == 3
        findKthNumber(m = 2, n = 3, k = 6) == 6

    [[Pythoness] Prompt:
 
    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named findKthNumber that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        Nearly everyone has used the Multiplication Table. The multiplication table of size m x n is an integer matrix mat where mat[i][j] == i * j (1-indexed).
        Given three integers m, n, and k, return the k^th smallest element in the m x n multiplication table.

        Constraints:

        1 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4
        1 <= k <= m * n

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        findKthNumber(m = 3, n = 3, k = 5) == 3
        findKthNumber(m = 2, n = 3, k = 6) == 6

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```
