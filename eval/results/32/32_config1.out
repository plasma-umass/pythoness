    Task:

        Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

        Constraints:

        0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4
        s[i] is '(', or ')'.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

        longestValidParentheses(s = "(()") == 2
        longestValidParentheses(s = ")()())") == 4
        longestValidParentheses(s = "") == 0
