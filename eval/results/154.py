    """Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.
You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
 
Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

 
Follow up: This problem is similar to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?""",
