    ```

    Task:

        You are given a string s and an integer k. Your task is to find the maximum difference between the frequency of two characters, freq[a] - freq[b], in a substring subs of s, such that:

        subs has a size of at least k.
        Character a has an odd frequency in subs.
        Character b has an even frequency in subs.

        Return the maximum difference.
        Note that subs can contain more than 2 distinct characters.

        Constraints:

        3 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4
        s consists only of digits '0' to '4'.
        The input is generated that at least one substring has a character with an even frequency and a character with an odd frequency.
        1 <= k <= s.length

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        maxDifference(s = "12233", k = 4) == -1
        maxDifference(s = "1122211", k = 3) == 1
        maxDifference(s = "110", k = 3) == -1

    You are given a string s and an integer k. Your task is to find the maximum difference between the frequency of two characters, freq[a] - freq[b], in a substring subs of s, such that:

    subs has a size of at least k.
    Character a has an odd frequency in subs.
    Character b has an even frequency in subs.

    Return the maximum difference.
    Note that subs can contain more than 2 distinct characters.

    Constraints:

    3 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4
    s consists only of digits '0' to '4'.
    The input is generated that at least one substring has a character with an even frequency and a character with an odd frequency.
