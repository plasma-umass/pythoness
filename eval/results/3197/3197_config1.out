    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named minimumSum that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        You are given a 2D binary array grid. You need to find 3 non-overlapping rectangles having non-zero areas with horizontal and vertical sides such that all the 1's in grid lie inside these rectangles.
        Return the minimum possible sum of the area of these rectangles.
        Note that the rectangles are allowed to touch.

        Constraints:

        1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 30
        grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
        The input is generated such that there are at least three 1's in grid.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        minimumSum(grid = [[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]) == 5
        minimumSum(grid = [[1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1]]) == 5

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:

    Task:

        You are given a 2D binary array grid. You need to find 3 non-overlapping rectangles having non-zero areas with horizontal and vertical sides such that all the 1's in grid lie inside these rectangles.
        Return the minimum possible sum of the area of these rectangles.
        Note that the rectangles are allowed to touch.

        Constraints:

        1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 30
        grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
        The input is generated such that there are at least three 1's in grid.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        minimumSum(grid = [[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]) == 5
        minimumSum(grid = [[1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1]]) == 5

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:

    Task:

        You are given a 2D binary array grid. You need to find 3 non-overlapping rectangles having non-zero areas with horizontal and vertical sides such that all the 1's in grid lie inside these rectangles.
        Return the minimum possible sum of the area of these rectangles.
        Note that the rectangles are allowed to touch.

        Constraints:

        1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 30
        grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
        The input is generated such that there are at least three 1's in grid.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        minimumSum(grid = [[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]) == 5
        minimumSum(grid = [[1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1]]) == 5

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```
