    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named gcdValues that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer array queries.
        Let gcdPairs denote an array obtained by calculating the GCD of all possible pairs (nums[i], nums[j]), where 0 <= i < j < n, and then sorting these values in ascending order.
        For each query queries[i], you need to find the element at index queries[i] in gcdPairs.
        Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the value at gcdPairs[queries[i]] for each query.
        The term gcd(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b.

        Constraints:

        2 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5
        1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4
        1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
        0 <= queries[i] < n * (n - 1) / 2

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        gcdValues(nums = [2,3,4], queries = [0,2,2]) == [1,2,2]
        gcdValues(nums = [4,4,2,1], queries = [5,3,1,0]) == [4,2,1,1]
        gcdValues(nums = [2,2], queries = [0,0]) == [2,2]

    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named gcdValues that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer array queries.
        Let gcdPairs denote an array obtained by calculating the GCD of all possible pairs (nums[i], nums[j]), where 0 <= i < j < n, and then sorting these values in ascending order.
        For each query queries[i], you need to find the element at index queries[i] in gcdPairs.
        Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the value at gcdPairs[queries[i]] for each query.
        The term gcd(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b.

        Constraints:

        2 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5
        1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4
        1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
        0 <= queries[i] < n * (n - 1) / 2

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        gcdValues(nums = [2,3,4], queries = [0,2,2]) == [1,2,2]
        gcdValues(nums = [4,4,2,1], queries = [5,3,1,0]) == [4,2,1,1]
        gcdValues(nums = [2,2], queries = [0,0]) == [2,2]
