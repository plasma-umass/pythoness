    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named longestCommonSubpath that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        There is a country of n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. In this country, there is a road connecting every pair of cities.
        There are m friends numbered from 0 to m - 1 who are traveling through the country. Each one of them will take a path consisting of some cities. Each path is represented by an integer array that contains the visited cities in order. The path may contain a city more than once, but the same city will not be listed consecutively.
        Given an integer n and a 2D integer array paths where paths[i] is an integer array representing the path of the i^th friend, return the length of the longest common subpath that is shared by every friend's path, or 0 if there is no common subpath at all.
        A subpath of a path is a contiguous sequence of cities within that path.

        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 10^5
        m == paths.length
        2 <= m <= 10^5
        sum(paths[i].length) <= 10^5
        0 <= paths[i][j] < n
        The same city is not listed multiple times consecutively in paths[i].

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        longestCommonSubpath(n = 5, paths = [[0,1,2,3,4],[2,3,4],[4,0,1,2,3]]) == 2
        longestCommonSubpath(n = 3, paths = [[0],[1],[2]]) == 0
        longestCommonSubpath(n = 5, paths = [[0,1,2,3,4],[4,3,2,1,0]]) == 1
