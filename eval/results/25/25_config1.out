    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function

    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.

    Task:

        Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
        k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function

    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.

    Task:

        Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
        k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
        You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
