    [[Pythoness] Prompt:
 
    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named reverseKGroup that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```
    Local Symbols:

    class ListNode(val, next):
        No documentation available.
        def __init__(self, val, next):
            No documentation available.
    ```

    Task:

        Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
        k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
        You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

        Constraints:

        The number of nodes in the list is n.
        1 <= k <= n <= 5000
        0 <= Node.val <= 1000

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        reverseKGroup(head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2) == [2,1,4,3,5]
        reverseKGroup(head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3) == [3,2,1,4,5]

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:

      [[Pythoness] Synthesized function: 
 

      def reverseKGroup(head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          """
          Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
          k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
          You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

          Constraints:

          The number of nodes in the list is n.
          1 <= k <= n <= 5000
          0 <= Node.val <= 1000

          Include a docstring containing the task description above.
    
          The function should pass the following tests:
              reverseKGroup(head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2) == [2,1,4,3,5]
              reverseKGroup(head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3) == [3,2,1,4,5]
