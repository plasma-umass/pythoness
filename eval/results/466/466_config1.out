    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named getMaxRepetitions that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        We define str = [s, n] as the string str which consists of the string s concatenated n times.

        For example, str == ["abc", 3] =="abcabcabc".

        We define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1.

        For example, s1 = "abc" can be obtained from s2 = "abdbec" based on our definition by removing the bolded underlined characters.

        You are given two strings s1 and s2 and two integers n1 and n2. You have the two strings str1 = [s1, n1] and str2 = [s2, n2].
        Return the maximum integer m such that str = [str2, m] can be obtained from str1.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
        s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
        1 <= n1, n2 <= 10^6

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        getMaxRepetitions(s1 = "acb", n1 = 4, s2 = "ab", n2 = 2) == 2
        getMaxRepetitions(s1 = "acb", n1 = 1, s2 = "acb", n2 = 1) == 1

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```

    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        We define str = [s, n] as the string str which consists of the string s concatenated n times.

        For example, str == ["abc", 3] =="abcabcabc".

        We define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1.

        For example, s1 = "abc" can be obtained from s2 = "abdbec" based on our definition by removing the bolded underlined characters.

        You are given two strings s1 and s2 and two integers n1 and n2. You have the two strings str1 = [s1, n1] and str2 = [s2, n2].
        Return the maximum integer m such that str = [str2, m] can be obtained from str1.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
        s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
        1 <= n1, n2 <= 10^6

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,

        getMaxRepetitions(s1 = "acb", n1 = 1, s2 = "acb", n2 = 1) == 1

    [[Pythoness] Prompt:
 
    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named getMaxRepetitions that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        We define str = [s, n] as the string str which consists of the string s concatenated n times.

        For example, str == ["abc", 3] =="abcabcabc".

        We define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1.

        For example, s1 = "abc" can be obtained from s2 = "abdbec" based on our definition by removing the bolded underlined characters.

        You are given two strings s1 and s2 and two integers n1 and n2. You have the two strings str1 = [s1, n1] and str2 = [s2, n2].
        Return the maximum integer m such that str = [str2, m] can be obtained from str1.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
        s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
        1 <= n1, n2 <= 10^6

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        getMaxRepetitions(s1 = "acb", n1 = 4, s2 = "ab", n2 = 2) == 2
        getMaxRepetitions(s1 = "acb", n1 = 1, s2 = "acb", n2 = 1) == 1

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```

    def getMaxRepetitions(s1: str, n1: int, s2: str, n2: int) -> int:
        """"""
