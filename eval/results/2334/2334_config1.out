    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named validSubarraySize that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.

    Task:

        You are given an integer array nums and an integer threshold.
        Find any subarray of nums of length k such that every element in the subarray is greater than threshold / k.
        Return the size of any such subarray. If there is no such subarray, return -1.
        A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

        Constraints:

        1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
        1 <= nums[i], threshold <= 10^9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        validSubarraySize(nums = [1,3,4,3,1], threshold = 6) == 3
        validSubarraySize(nums = [6,5,6,5,8], threshold = 7) == 1

    [[Pythoness] Prompt:
 
    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named validSubarraySize that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        You are given an integer array nums and an integer threshold.
        Find any subarray of nums of length k such that every element in the subarray is greater than threshold / k.
        Return the size of any such subarray. If there is no such subarray, return -1.
        A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

        Constraints:

        1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
        1 <= nums[i], threshold <= 10^9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        validSubarraySize(nums = [1,3,4,3,1], threshold = 6) == 3
        validSubarraySize(nums = [6,5,6,5,8], threshold = 7) == 1

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```
