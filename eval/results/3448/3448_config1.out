    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named countSubstrings that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given a string s consisting of digits.
        Return the number of substrings of s divisible by their non-zero last digit.
        Note: A substring may contain leading zeros.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        s consists of digits only.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        countSubstrings(s = "12936") == 11
        countSubstrings(s = "5701283") == 18
        countSubstrings(s = "1010101010") == 25

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:

    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named countSubstrings that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given a string s consisting of digits.
        Return the number of substrings of s divisible by their non-zero last digit.
        Note: A substring may contain leading zeros.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        s consists of digits only.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        countSubstrings(s = "12936") == 11
        countSubstrings(s = "5701283") == 18
        countSubstrings(s = "1010101010") == 25

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
