    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named separateSquares that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        You are given a 2D integer array squares. Each squares[i] = [xi, yi, li] represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.
        Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area covered by squares above the line equals the total area covered by squares below the line.
        Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
        Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted only once in this version.

        Constraints:

        1 <= squares.length <= 5 * 10^4
        squares[i] = [xi, yi, li]
        squares[i].length == 3
        0 <= xi, yi <= 10^9
        1 <= li <= 10^9
        The total area of all the squares will not exceed 10^15.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

        separateSquares(squares = [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]]) == 1.00000
        separateSquares(squares = [[0,0,2],[1,1,1]]) == 1.00000

    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare

    Task:

        You are given a 2D integer array squares. Each squares[i] = [xi, yi, li] represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.
        Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area covered by squares above the line equals the total area covered by squares below the line.
        Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
        Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted only once in this version.

        Constraints:

        The total area of all the squares will not exceed 10^15.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above

    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
