    "problem_statement": "You are given a 2D integer array squares. Each squares[i] = [xi, yi, li] represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.\nFind the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area covered by squares above the line equals the total area covered by squares below the line.\nAnswers within 10^-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\nNote: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted only once in this version.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: squares = [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]]\nOutput: 1.00000\nExplanation:\n\nAny horizontal line between y = 1 and y = 2 results in an equal split, with 1 square unit above and 1 square unit below. The minimum y-value is 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: squares = [[0,0,2],[1,1,1]]\nOutput: 1.00000\nExplanation:\n\nSince the blue square overlaps with the red square, it will not be counted again. Thus, the line y = 1 splits the squares into two equal parts.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= squares.length <= 5 * 10^4\nsquares[i] = [xi, yi, li]\nsquares[i].length == 3\n0 <= xi, yi <= 10^9\n1 <= li <= 10^9\nThe total area of all the squares will not exceed 10^15.\n\n",
