    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named findSubstring that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.
        A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

        For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.

        Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^4
        1 <= words.length <= 5000
        1 <= words[i].length <= 30
        s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        findSubstring(s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]) == [0,9]
        findSubstring(s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]) == []

    """
    You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.
    A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

    For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.

    Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.

    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 10^4
    1 <= words.length <= 5000
    1 <= words[i].length <= 30
    s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
