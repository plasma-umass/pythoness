    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named minSwap that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Below is a list of classes and functions that may be used in the implementation.
    Included is their name, signature, and docstring. Do not declare
    these functions or classes and do not import anything to use them.
    ```

    ```

    Task:

        You are given two integer arrays of the same length nums1 and nums2. In one operation, you are allowed to swap nums1[i] with nums2[i].

        For example, if nums1 = [1,2,3,8], and nums2 = [5,6,7,4], you can swap the element at i = 3 to obtain nums1 = [1,2,3,4] and nums2 = [5,6,7,8].

        Return the minimum number of needed operations to make nums1 and nums2 strictly increasing. The test cases are generated so that the given input always makes it possible.
        An array arr is strictly increasing if and only if arr[0] < arr[1] < arr[2] < ... < arr[arr.length - 1].

        Constraints:

        2 <= nums1.length <= 10^5
        nums2.length == nums1.length
        0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 2 * 10^5

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        minSwap(nums1 = [1,3,5,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,7]) == 1
        minSwap(nums1 = [0,3,5,8,9], nums2 = [2,1,4,6,9]) == 1

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
