    "problem_statement": "You are given an array points of size n and an integer m. There is another array gameScore of size n, where gameScore[i] represents the score achieved at the i^th game. Initially, gameScore[i] == 0 for all i.\nYou start at index -1, which is outside the array (before the first position at index 0). You can make at most m moves. In each move, you can either:\n\nIncrease the index by 1 and add points[i] to gameScore[i].\nDecrease the index by 1 and add points[i] to gameScore[i].\n\nNote that the index must always remain within the bounds of the array after the first move.\nReturn the maximum possible minimum value in gameScore after at most m moves.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [2,4], m = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nInitially, index i = -1 and gameScore = [0, 0].\n\n\n\nMove\nIndex\ngameScore\n\n\n\n\nIncrease i\n0\n[2, 0]\n\n\nIncrease i\n1\n[2, 4]\n\n\nDecrease i\n0\n[4, 4]\n\n\n\nThe minimum value in gameScore is 4, and this is the maximum possible minimum among all configurations. Hence, 4 is the output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [1,2,3], m = 5\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nInitially, index i = -1 and gameScore = [0, 0, 0].\n\n\n\nMove\nIndex\ngameScore\n\n\n\n\nIncrease i\n0\n[1, 0, 0]\n\n\nIncrease i\n1\n[1, 2, 0]\n\n\nDecrease i\n0\n[2, 2, 0]\n\n\nIncrease i\n1\n[2, 4, 0]\n\n\nIncrease i\n2\n[2, 4, 3]\n\n\n\nThe minimum value in gameScore is 2, and this is the maximum possible minimum among all configurations.
