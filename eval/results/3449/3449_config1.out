    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named maxScore that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given an array points of size n and an integer m. There is another array gameScore of size n, where gameScore[i] represents the score achieved at the i^th game. Initially, gameScore[i] == 0 for all i.
        You start at index -1, which is outside the array (before the first position at index 0). You can make at most m moves. In each move, you can either:

        Increase the index by 1 and add points[i] to gameScore[i].
        Decrease the index by 1 and add points[i] to gameScore[i].

        Note that the index must always remain within the bounds of the array after the first move.
        Return the maximum possible minimum value in gameScore after at most m moves.

        Constraints:

        2 <= n == points.length <= 5 * 10^4
        1 <= points[i] <= 10^6
        1 <= m <= 10^9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        maxScore(points = [2,4], m = 3) == 4
        maxScore(points = [1,2,3], m = 5) == 2

        Decrease the index by 1 and add points[i] to gameScore[i].

    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named maxScore that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given an array points of size n and an integer m. There is another array gameScore of size n, where gameScore[i] represents the score achieved at the i^th game. Initially, gameScore[i] == 0 for all i.
        You start at index -1, which is outside the array (before the first position at index 0). You can make at most m moves. In each move, you can either:

        Increase the index by 1 and add points[i] to gameScore[i].
        Decrease the index by 1 and add points[i] to gameScore[i].

        Note that the index must always remain within the bounds of the array after the first move.
        Return the maximum possible minimum value in gameScore after at most m moves.

        Constraints:

        2 <= n == points.length <= 5 * 10^4
        1 <= points[i] <= 10^6
        1 <= m <= 10^9

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        maxScore(points = [2,4], m = 3) == 4
        maxScore(points = [1,2,3], m = 5) == 2

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
