    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named solveSudoku that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
        A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

        Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
        Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
        Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

        The '.' character indicates empty cells.

        Constraints:

        board.length == 9
        board[i].length == 9
        board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
        It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        solveSudoku(board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]) == [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]

    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named solveSudoku that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
        A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

        Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
        Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
        Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

        The '.' character indicates empty cells.

        Constraints:

        board.length == 9
        board[i].length == 9
        board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
        It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        solveSudoku(board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]) == [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]

    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named solveSudoku that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
        A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

        Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
        Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
        Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

        The '.' character indicates empty cells.

        Constraints:

        board.length == 9
        board[i].length == 9
        board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
        It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:

          Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
          A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

          Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
          Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
          Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
