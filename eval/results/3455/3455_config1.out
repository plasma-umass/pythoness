    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named shortestMatchingSubstring that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given a string s and a pattern string p, where p contains exactly two '*' characters.
        The '*' in p matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
        Return the length of the shortest substring in s that matches p. If there is no such substring, return -1.
        Note: The empty substring is considered valid.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        2 <= p.length <= 10^5
        s contains only lowercase English letters.
        p contains only lowercase English letters and exactly two '*'.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        shortestMatchingSubstring(s = "abaacbaecebce", p = "ba*c*ce") == 8
        shortestMatchingSubstring(s = "baccbaadbc", p = "cc*baa*adb") == -1

    Task:

        You are given a string s and a pattern string p, where p contains exactly two '*' characters.
        The '*' in p matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

        s contains only lowercase English letters.
        p contains only lowercase English letters and exactly two '*'.

    Produce a JSON object with code for a Python function
    named shortestMatchingSubstring that performs the following task as
    a field "code". Only produce output that can be parsed as
    JSON. 

    Task:

        You are given a string s and a pattern string p, where p contains exactly two '*' characters.
        The '*' in p matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
        Return the length of the shortest substring in s that matches p. If there is no such substring, return -1.
        Note: The empty substring is considered valid.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        2 <= p.length <= 10^5
        s contains only lowercase English letters.
        p contains only lowercase English letters and exactly two '*'.

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        shortestMatchingSubstring(s = "abaacbaecebce", p = "ba*c*ce") == 8
        shortestMatchingSubstring(s = "baccbaadbc", p = "cc*baa*adb") == -1
        shortestMatchingSubstring(s = "a", p = "**") == 0
        shortestMatchingSubstring(s = "madlogic", p = "*adlogi*") == 6

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```
