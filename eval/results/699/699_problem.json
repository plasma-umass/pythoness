    "problem_statement": "There are several squares being dropped onto the X-axis of a 2D plane.\nYou are given a 2D integer array positions where positions[i] = [lefti, sideLengthi] represents the i^th square with a side length of sideLengthi that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate lefti.\nEach square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.\nAfter each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.\nReturn an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the i^th square.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: positions = [[1,2],[2,3],[6,1]]\nOutput: [2,5,5]\nExplanation:\nAfter the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 2.\nAfter the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.\nAfter the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.\nThus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: positions = [[100,100],[200,100]]\nOutput: [100,100]\nExplanation:\nAfter the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 100.\nAfter the second drop, the tallest stack is either square 1 or square 2, both with heights of 100.\nThus, we return an answer of [100, 100].\nNote that square 2 only brushes the right side of square 1, which does not count as landing on it.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= positions.length <= 1000\n1 <= lefti <= 10^8\n1 <= sideLengthi <= 10^6\n\n",
