    Task:

        You are given two positive integer arrays nums and target, of the same length.
        In a single operation, you can select any subarray of nums and increment each element within that subarray by 1 or decrement each element within that subarray by 1.
        Return the minimum number of operations required to make nums equal to the array target.

        Constraints:

        1 <= nums.length == target.length <= 10^5
        1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 10^8

    Include a docstring containing the task description above
    (without the word "Task:").  The function should be
    entirely self-contained, with all imports, code, and data, except
    for the above helper functions. Do not define any other functions, classes,
    or methods inside the function you are writing.

    The function should pass the following tests:
        minimumOperations(nums = [3,5,1,2], target = [4,6,2,4]) == 2
        minimumOperations(nums = [1,3,2], target = [2,1,4]) == 5

    Return only a single method or function definition. Use this template for your response:
    ```

    def minimumOperations(nums: List[int], target: List[int]) -> int:
        """"""
